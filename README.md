# Heater-in-java
This Java project models a temperature control system. The Heater class adjusts temperature with methods to increase or decrease it by a set increment, while respecting defined min/max limits. JUnit tests verify functionality, ensuring the heater's temperature remains within safe bounds.
This project involves implementing a class called Heater in Java, simulating a basic temperature control system. The Heater class models a heater with attributes such as temperature, increment value, and minimum/maximum temperature limits. The project starts with an incomplete version of the class, which is then extended and tested.

The class includes methods to increase (warmer()) and decrease (cooler()) the temperature by an adjustable increment. It also allows for setting custom increment values via the setIncrement() method.
The heater's temperature can be adjusted within a specified range, with built-in constraints to ensure it doesnâ€™t exceed the maximum or drop below the minimum allowed temperatures.
The project employs interactive testing within the BlueJ environment and utilizes the JUnit framework to run automated tests on the class' functionality.
The final implementation passes all JUnit test cases, verifying that the Heater class correctly handles temperature adjustments and increment settings while respecting the defined limits.
